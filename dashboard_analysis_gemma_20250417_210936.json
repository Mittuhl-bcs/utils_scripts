Dashboard Data Extraction**\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the data extracted from the dashboard:\n\n| Metric Category      | March (13) | April (14) | April (15) |\n| -------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| **Blue (Secondary)** | 364095     | 364095     | 364095     |\n| **Purple**           | 69686      | 69686      | 69686      |\n| **Orange-Price**     | 13703      | 13703      | 13703      |\n| **Orange-Primary**   | 69686      | 69686      | 69686      |\n| **Orange-Secondary** | 364095     | 364095     | 364095     |\n\n*   **Note:** All metrics are populated and have numerical data present. There are no blank sections or missing values.\n\n**2. Numerical Data Extraction (Detailed)**\n\n| Metric Category      | Current Value | Previous Value | Change (±) | Color  | Arrows |\n| -------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ------ | ------ |\n| **Blue (Secondary)** | 364095        | 364095         | (±0)       | Red    |        |\n| **Purple**           | 69686         | 69686          | (±0)       | Red    |        |\n| **Orange-Price**     | 13703         | 13703          | (±0)       | Red    |        |\n| **Orange-Primary**   | 69686         | 69686          | (±0)       | Red    |        |\n| **Orange-Secondary** | 364095        | 364095         | (±0)       | Red    |        |\n\n*   **Note:** All numbers are red, indicating a concerning trend. There are no up/down arrows.\n\n**3. Chart Data**\n\n*   **Chart 1 (Right side):** The charts represent the same data as the numerical values. The exact data points visible include: March: 13, 14, 15. April: 14, 15.\n*   **Peak Values:** The peak values for April 14 & 15 are 364095 and 364095, respectively.\n\n**4. Trend Analysis & Business Implications**\n\n*   **Trend Analysis:** All categories show a flat trend. There is no increase or decrease in any of the values.\n*   **Concerning Values:** The Red color of all metrics is a strong indicator of concern.\n*   **Possible Causes for Large Decreases (If Applicable - Not Applicable in this case):** Since no decrease is recorded, it is impossible to determine the possible causes. However, if any were to be displayed, potential causes would involve external market factors, changes in user behavior, or issues within the data collection process.\n*   **Recommended Actions (If Applicable - Not Applicable in this case):** Without a decrease, the immediate action would be to investigate whether the values are truly stable or whether there’s a hidden issue with the reporting process.  It's crucial to verify the data integrity.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to explore a specific aspect of this analysis further!"
